# ASTROR
Can you defeat ASTROR, the dark lord of asteroids, from his evil uhm asteroid-related misdeeds? Play now... if can handle the action.

This is a toy project and my first Javascript code. I don't plan to actually learn Javascript, my goal was just to learn some basic syntax.

# SETUP
1. Download files
2. Right click "index.html" and select "open in google chrome"

I have no idea if this works on all machines / other browsers but it does for me
